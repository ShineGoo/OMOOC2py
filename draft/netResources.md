## UDP sockets
### Definitions:
* [Wiki def for network socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) 
  A net work socket is an endpoint of an inter-process communication across a computer
  network. Today, most communication between computers is based on the Internet Protocol;
  therefore most network sockets are Internet sockets.
  
  An Internet socket is characterized by at least the following:
  
  * Local socket address: Local IP address and port number
  
  * Protocol: A transport protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, raw IP). Thus, TCP port 53 and UDP
    port 53 are distinct sockets.
